//! Edits not yet published (#1385): whether a layer read whole from a Shapefile or GeoJSON file
//! holds rows its file lacks, for the Layers pane. The layer's rows are hashed
//! (`rustgis_data::sync::rows_digest`) on a thread of their own and compared with the record of
//! the last sync; the answer is kept until the rows, fields, coordinate system or record change.
//! An edit copies the rows, so a changed layer is told by their allocation without a hash. The
//! rows hashed are held only while their hash runs. A hash whose layer changed or went away is
//! cancelled (`rows_digest` looks at Cancel between rows), and no more hashes run at once than
//! the thread setting allows (`rustgis_data::threads::max`), so opening a project of many large
//! layers doesn't start one each. Nothing is counted: the mark is a status, not a run with
//! progress. App state alone: nothing here dirties the project or adds an undo step.
