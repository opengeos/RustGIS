//! The iOS app: the shell ([`crate::shell`]) in winit's UIKit window, with UIKit's document
//! picker, Core Location and the camera as its [`Platform`], called through `objc2`.
//!
//! Everything here runs on the main thread, where UIKit calls its delegates: between frames, as
//! the run loop turns. What they report waits in [`Shared`] until the next frame takes it, as the
//! Android activity's events do; only copying a picked document runs on a thread of its own.
//!
//! The delegates are Objective-C classes made here (`define_class!`): UIKit keeps only a weak
//! reference to a delegate, so [`Ios`] holds each one for as long as it is wanted.
// UIKit's delegates are Objective-C classes declared here, and a few of its calls are unsafe;
// each block says why it holds.
#![expect(unsafe_code, reason = "Objective-C classes and the few UIKit calls objc2 marks unsafe; see each SAFETY")]
